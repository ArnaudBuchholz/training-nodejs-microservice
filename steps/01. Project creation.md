# Step 1 : Project creation

## Prerequisite

* Install LTS version of Node.js : https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Initialize the repository

* Create a new folder named `workshop-microservice`  : `mkdir workshop-microservice`
* Change current directory to the created one : `cd workshop-microservice`
* Execute `npm init` *(keep the default values by pressing enter after each questions)*

```
...\workshop-microservice>npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

Is this OK? (yes)
```

> Ouput of npm init

**After** this step, a file `package.json` is created in the directory :

```json
{
  "name": "workshop-microservice",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

> package.json

> NOTE
>> This [`package.json`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json) holds **metadata** relevant to the project and it is used for managing the project's **dependencies**, **scripts**, version and a whole lot more.
