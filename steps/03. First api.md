# Step 3 : First API

## Introduction

Now that the API gateway exists, let's create a **first API** : the test one.
In order to introduce later the **service registry**, no specific port will be configured when exposing the entry point.
Instead, the `express` framework will select one **free port** in the **operating system**.

## The test API

To keep things simple, the test API will expose only one **entry point** available through the GET method : `GET /test`

The response will contain the following headers :
* `x-echo` : if the **incoming request** contains the `x-echo` header, the value is sent back
* `x-service-version` : the version of the service (`1`)
* `x-service-timestamp` : the date when the service was requested (using [Extended ISO 861 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601))

> NOTE
>> The goal is to illustrate the usage of the **request** parameter.

And the textual answer `TESTED`

## Creating the test API service

* In the `workshop-microservice/src/services` directory
* Create a new file named `test.js`
* Copy the following code in the file :

```javascript
const express = require('express')

const app = express()

app.disable('etag')

app.get('/test', (req, res) => {
  const echo = req.headers['x-echo']
  if (echo) {
    res.setHeader('x-echo', echo)
  }
  res.setHeader('x-service-version', 1)
  res.setHeader('x-service-timestamp', new Date().toISOString())
  res.send('TESTED')
})

const service = app.listen(0, () => {
  const port = service.address().port
  console.log(`Test service listening on port ${port}`)
})
```

> First version of the test service

> NOTE
>> The service might be accessed from a **browser** *(the API gateway will **forward** requests to it)*. By default, express **implements [ETag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/ETag)** and it requires advanced programming to **manage it properly**.
>> In particular, when an incoming request contain the ETag *(header `If-none-match`)*, express **automatically answers** with the status code `304`. This behavior is **turned off** with the instruction `app.disable('etag')`.

## Starting the test service

To start the service from the `workshop-microservice` directory, simply execute `node src/services/test`.

```
workshop-microservice>node src/services/test
Test service listening on port 56070
```

## Testing the test service

One way to test the service is to open a browser and use the following URLs :

* http://localhost:56070/test : the `TEST` text should appear in the browser. Use the network tab to check the headers.

> NOTE
>> **Change** the port to fit the one allocated by your instance.

* Use Postman to **inject** the `x-echo` header and check that it is **properly sent back**.

> NOTE
>> The header is **not** case sensitive.
