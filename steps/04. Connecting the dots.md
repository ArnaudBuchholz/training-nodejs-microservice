# Step 4 : Connecting the dots

## Introduction

As of now, two services are existing :

* The **API Gateway** which is the service which **clients can access**
* The **Test API** which entry point should not be available to customers

> NOTE
>> In the current implementation, the Test API can be accessed from the browser. In a **real environment**, it would be on a **separate network** accessible only by the API Gateway and other services.
>> From a **security** point of view, this would reduce the **attack surface** of the system. This also enable the **replacement** of the service *(since it can't be accessed directly)*, the **API gateway** being the only entry point for the clients.

One question remains : how can the API Gateway **expose** the `/api/test` entry point to **trigger the Test API** ?

In this step, a **third service** is created to address the following problems :
* Have the API Gateway **know** where the **Test API is located**
* Give the Test API **a way to tell** the API Gateway when it is **up and running** *(or stopped)*

## The service registry

The **registry service purpose** is to keep track of **running services**. It offers two different interfaces :

* For the API Gateway *(or any service that wants to communicate with another service)* :
  - `GET /` : lists all registered services
  - `GET /<service name>` : gets one service location given its name *(if registered)*
* For a service :
  - `POST /register` : **register** a service location, a service ID is returned
  - `POST /<service ID>` : allows the service to signal it is **still alive**
  - `DELETE /<service ID>` : **unregister** a service location

> NOTES
>> * These APIs are defined with verbs which are **semantically close** to the purpose of the action.
>> * It is possible to **split** the two interfaces and build **two different microservices**. However, they would need to **share the list** of known services. For **simplicity**, only one is built in this workshop.
>> * The **heartbeat** mechanism is a way for the registry service to know that a service is **still running**. If the registered service **crashes unexpectedly**, it may not have the time to signal unregister itself. **Other mechanisms** might be required to **sanitize** the system : for instance, when a call to the service fails.

## The service registry helper

Starting from now, **every** service must **register** itself to the service registry.

Instead of **copy / pasting** this logic in every individual implementation, a **Node.js module** is created to factorize it.

### Defining the interface

* In the `workshop-microservice/src/` directory
* Create a new file named `registry.js`
* Copy the following code in the file :

```javascript
const localhost = '127.0.0.1'
const currentHost = process.env.CURRENT_HOST || localhost

module.exports = {
  /**
   * Retrieves location of a service from its name
   * @param {string} name Name of the service to retreive
   * @return {object} Location of the service (host and port)
   */
  async getLocationOf (name) {},

  /**
   * Registers the current service, implement heartbeat and graceful stop
   * @param {string} name Name of the service
   * @param {number} port Port of the service
   * @param {string} host Host of the service
   * @return {Promise<string>} service ID
   */
  async register (name, port, host = currentHost) {},

  /** Unregister the current service */
  async unregister () {}
}
```

> Interface of the registry helper

> NOTE
>> For **simplicity** reason, the **current host** is considered to be the **local host**. On a real system, the host might be **unique** per service *(for instance when using Docker)*.
>> It is possible to **obtain** the current host from the **express server** *(host information contains `'::'` which means localhost in IPv6)* but it might be required to use a different name / ip depending on the way the **host is connected to the network interface** *(bridge, overlay...)*. The use of an **environment variable** (here `CURRENT_HOST`) may simplify the configuration.

### Updating the test service

Now that the interface is **defined**, the test service can **register itself**.

* Edit the `workshop-microservice/src/services/test.js` file
* Change the following code :

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const registry = require('../registry')

const app = express()

/* ... */

const server = app.listen(0, () => {
  const port = server.address().port
  console.log(`Test service listening on port ${port}`)
  registry.register('test', port)
})
```

> Test service registering

## Creating the registry service

Building the registry service first gives a better **understanding** on how the helper must be filled.

* In the `workshop-microservice/src/services` directory
* Create a new file named `registry.js`
* Copy the following code in the file :

```javascript
const express = require('express')

const app = express()

const services = []

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(services)
})

const port = process.env.SERVICE_REGISTRY_PORT || 8081
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Service registry listening on port ${port}`)
})
```

> First version of the registry service

## Getting a service by its name

### Service registry

Unlike previous examples, express must be configured to **match an URL** containing a **dynamic part** : `GET /<service name>`.
Fortunately, express supports patterns in the URL (see [route parameters](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)).

* Edit the `workshop-microservice/src/services/registry.js` file
* Change the following code :

```javascript
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(services)
})

app.get('/:name', (req, res) => {
  const serviceName = req.params.name
  const service = services.find(item => item.name === serviceName)
  if (service) {
    return res.send(service)
  }
  res.sendStatus(404)
})
```

> Implementation of the service retreival API

### Registry helper

The implementation of the `getLocationOf` consists in **triggering an HTTP request** to the **registry service**.

Node.js' [**`http` native module**](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) is low-level and is difficult to manipulate.

Instead, the [`axios` package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) encapsulates HTTP requests in a simpler manner.

![axios version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/axios.svg)
![axios downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/axios.svg)
![install size](https://packagephobia.com/badge?p=axios)

To install the package, execute `npm axios --save`

Once the package is installed :

* Edit the `workshop-microservice/src/registry.js` file
* Change the following code :

```javascript
const axios = require('axios')
const localhost = '127.0.0.1'
const currentHost = process.env.CURRENT_HOST || localhost
const serviceRegistryHost = process.env.SERVICE_REGISTRY_HOST || localhost
const serviceRegistryPort = process.env.SERVICE_REGISTRY_PORT || 8081
const serviceRegistryUrl = `http://${serviceRegistryHost}:${serviceRegistryPort}`

module.exports = {
  /**
   * Retrieves location of a service from its name
   * @param {string} name Name of the service to retreive
   * @return {object} Location of the service (host and port)
   */
  async getLocationOf (name) {
    const response = await axios.get(`${serviceRegistryUrl}/${name}`)
    return response.data
  },
```

> Implementation of getLocationOf in the registry helper

## Registering a service

### Service registry

To enable **service registration**, a new API is created to **receive service details** *(name, host and port)* : `POST /register`.

It means that after **matching** the request **verb** and **URL**, the handler must wait for the **body of the request** to be received. Indeed, HTTP requests are **asynchronous**. Furthermore, the **simpler** way to transmit the information is [**JSON**](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). Hence the handler must **deserialize** the **request body** to generate a valid **JavaScript object** from the JSON description.

Since it is a very **common task**, express provides the **helper** `express.json()` : it augments the request object with a **`body` member** containing the **deserialized JSON**.

* Edit the `workshop-microservice/src/services/registry.js` file
* Change the following code :

```javascript
const services = []
let id = 0

/* ... */

app.get('/:name', (req, res) => {
  /* ... */
})

app.post('/register', express.json(), (req, res) => {
  const service = {
    ...req.body,
    registered: Date.now(),
    id: ++id
  }
  services.push(service)
  console.log('REGISTER  ', new Date(), service.id, service.name, service.host, service.port)
  res.send(service.id.toString())
})
```

> Implementation of the service registration API

> NOTE
>> In the current version, the id is a simple **counter**. In a safer implementation, a [universally unique IDentifier](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) would be used.

### Registry helper

**Symmetrically**, in the registry helper, a request **transmits** the registered service information to the proper endpoint.

* Edit the `workshop-microservice/src/registry.js` file
* Change the following code :

```javascript
const serviceRegistryUrl = `http://${serviceRegistryHost}:${serviceRegistryPort}`

let serviceId

/* ... */

  /**
   * Registers the current service, implement heartbeat and graceful stop
   * @param {string} name Name of the service
   * @param {number} port Port of the service
   * @param {string} host Host of the service
   * @return {Promise<string>} service ID
   */
  async register (name, port, host = currentHost) {
    try {
      const response = await axios.post(`${serviceRegistryUrl}/register`, { name, port, host })
      serviceId = response.data
      console.log(`${name}Â registered with ID : ${serviceId}`)
    } catch (reason) {
      console.error(`Unable to register ${name}`, reason.toString())
    }
  },
```

> Basic implementation of register in the registry helper

> NOTE
>> The `register` API will **evolve** to also implement the **heartbeat** as well as the automatic **de-registeration** when the process is terminated.

## Service heartbeat

### Service registry

The service, once **registered**, must send **regular updates** to signal that it is **still alive**. The registry service receives the call to `POST /<service ID>` and **keeps track** of the **last received update**.

Later this information can be used to **determine** if the **registration must be dropped**.

> NOTES
>> The registry service exposes **two different** `POST` APIs. It is possible to create **several handlers** for **similar path** in express : they are processed in the **order of declaration**.
>> Also, it is possible to have **more than one handler** processing the **same incoming request**.

* Edit the `workshop-microservice/src/services/registry.js` file
* Change the following code :

```javascript
app.post('/register', express.json(), (req, res) => {
  /* ... */
})

app.post('/:id', (req, res) => {
  const id = parseInt(req.params.id, 10)
  const service = services.find(item => item.id === id)
  if (service) {
    service.lastHeartbeat = Date.now()
    console.log('HEARTBEAT ', new Date(), service.id, service.name)
    return res.sendStatus(200)
  }
  res.sendStatus(404)
})
```

> Implementation of the heartbeat API in the registry service

### Registry helper

In order to **facilitate** service development, the hearbeat implementation is **enclosed within the helper**. Once registered, an [**interval timer**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval) is defined to call the endpoint regularly *(in this version, the delay is **hardcoded**)*.

* Edit the `workshop-microservice/src/registry.js` file
* Change the following code :

```javascript
let serviceId
let intervalId

/* ... */

  /**
   * Registers the current service, implement heartbeat and graceful stop
   * @param {string} name Name of the service
   * @param {number} port Port of the service
   * @param {string} host Host of the service
   * @return {Promise<string>} service ID
   */
  async register (name, port, host = currentHost) {
    try {
      const response = await axios.post(`${serviceRegistryUrl}/register`, { name, port, host })
      serviceId = response.data
      intervalId = setInterval(() => {
        axios.post(`${serviceRegistryUrl}/${serviceId}`)
          .catch(reason => console.error(`Unable to send a heartbeat to registry : ${reason}`))
      }, 5000)
    } catch (reason) {
      console.error(`Unable to register ${name}`, reason.toString())
    }
  },
```

## Unregistering a service

### Service registry

Last but not least, an endpoint is exposed to let the services **unregister** themselves.

* Edit the `workshop-microservice/src/services/registry.js` file
* Change the following code :

```javascript
app.post('/:id', (req, res) => {
  /* ... */
})

app.delete('/:id', (req, res) => {
  const id = parseInt(req.params.id, 10)
  const index = services.findIndex(item => item.id === id)
  if (index !== undefined) {
    const service = services[index]
    console.log('UNREGISTER', new Date(), service.id, service.name)
    services.splice(index, 1)
    return res.sendStatus(204)
  }
  res.sendStatus(404)
})
```

> Implementation of the unregister API in the registry service

### Registry helper

* Edit the `workshop-microservice/src/registry.js` file
* Change the following code :

```javascript
  /**
   * Registers the current service, implement heartbeat and graceful stop
   * @param {string} name Name of the service
   * @param {number} port Port of the service
   * @param {string} host Host of the service
   * @return {Promise<string>} service ID
   */
  async register (name, port, host = currentHost) {
    try {
      const response = await axios.post(`${serviceRegistryUrl}/register`, { name, port, host })
      serviceId = response.data
      intervalId = setInterval(() => {
        axios.post(`${serviceRegistryUrl}/${serviceId}`)
          .catch(reason => console.error(`Unable to send a heartbeat to registry : ${reason}`))
      }, 5000)
      process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
        await this.unregister()
        process.exit(0)
      })
    } catch (reason) {
      console.error(`Unable to register ${name}`, reason.toString())
    }
  },

  /** Unregister the current service */
  async unregister () {
    if (serviceId) {
      clearInterval(intervalId)
      await axios.delete(`${serviceRegistryUrl}/${serviceId}`)
        .catch(reason => console.error(`Unable to unregister service from registry : ${reason}`))
      serviceId = undefined
    }
  }
```

> Implementation of unregister in the registry helper

## Link the API gateway with the test service

Everything is in place, the **final step** consists in linking the API gateway with the test service. When a call to `/api/test` is made :

* The API service **queries the registry service** to obtain the **location of the test service**
* The **incoming request** is **forwarded** using axios
* The API service **waits** for the response
* Once the response comes back from the test service, it is **returned to the client**

**Error handling** is added to ensure that the client always receive a **controlled response**.

* Edit the `workshop-microservice/src/api.js` file
* Change the following code :

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const axios = require('axios')
const registry = require('../registry')

/* ... */

app.get('/', (req, res) => { /* ... */ })

// /api/test --> test service
app.get('/api/test', async function (req, res) {
  try {
    const { host, port } = await registry.getLocationOf('test')
    axios.get(`http://${host}:${port}/test`, {
      headers: req.headers
    })
      .then(response => {
        res.status(response.status)
        res.set(response.headers)
        res.send(response.data)
      })
      .catch(err => {
        console.error(err.toString())
        res.sendStatus(500)
      })
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err.toString())
    res.sendStatus(500)
  }
})
```
